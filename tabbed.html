            <h3>What is 40k?</h3>
            <p>The most simple explanation for Warhammer 40k is it is a miniature wargame where tiny models are used to
                play the game.
                40k is one of many wargames produced by Games Workshop but is by far the most popular and successful.
                There are many different ways to play 40k and many factions one can use on the table top all you need
                are the rules and models for the faction itself.
                While not a cheap hobby to get into it is very enjoyable if you decide to continue with it.</p>
            <h3> The most popular wargame in the world.</h3>
            <p>Warhammer 40k is indeed the most famous miniature wargame in the world. In fact it is very unlikely that
                you have not seen at least one thing from 40k.
                The most likely thing one has either seen is or heard of is the titular Space Marine, the poster boys of
                the franchise.
                Or perhaps you have seen one of the many books from 40k or even heard the phrase "Blood for the Blood
                God, Skulls for the skull throne" a very famous saying both in universe and out of it.</p>

            <h3>The universe of 40k</h3>
            <p>Warhammer 40,000 is noted for its science fantasy setting in the distant future, where a stagnant human
                civilisation is beset by hostile aliens and supernatural creatures.
                It is a universe built entirely on satire, and is full of references to the real world, some subtle and
                some very obvious.
                A key part of 40k is that there are no good guys, every faction is there own shade of evil, while some
                are worse than others all do some terrible things.
                The main human faction is the Imperium of Man which follows the faith of the God Emperor. They are a
                zealous people who do terrible things and destroy anyone that isn't human or doesn't belive in the God
                Emperor.</p>
            <h3>The worst world to live in</h3>
            <p>Warhammer 40,000 is quite possibly one of if not the darkest universe to ever exsist in. Everything
                sucks, and most likely you are going to die a horrible death if you were to live in this universe.
                Either the literal forces of "Hell", aliens and other humans want nothing more than to destroy you just
                for the crime of being born.
                But thats kind of the beauty of 40k,in most fiction the villains are the coolest part of the story and
                when everyone is a villain, then everyone is pretty cool. </p>

        <div class="content" id="tab3">
            <h3>Factions</h3>
            <p>Currently there are 24 playable factions on the tabletop, I own and use 8 of them.
                My personal favorites have to be the Tyranids an alien swarm Driven by the imperatives of the almighty
                Hive Mind,
                their swarms sweep over world after world in a living tide of biological killing-machines, devouring
                every last shred of biomass in their path.
                And the Chaos Space Marines They are the Imperium's fallen heroes, superhuman warriors who sold their
                souls for the promise of power gifted from the Dark Gods.</p>
            <h3>Other Factions</h3>
            <p>Some of the other factions are the souless Necrons an alien race of living metal robots who seek to
                restore their ancient empire, or the many varients of Space Marines the elite super human shock troops
                of the Imperium.
                Or maybe you want to represent the normal fighting force of the Imperium the Astra Militarum, or allies
                to the Imperium hailing from Mars the Adeptus Mechanicus
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="tab4">
            <h3>Models</h3>
            <p>To actually play the game you need models which you can buy seperately. The next step is to build and
                paint the mini itself.
                This is what truly makes 40k so enjoyable, the creative freedom of building the models. You can make
                them hyper realistic or very stylized if you want to.
                I lean more towards realistic but have done some odd paint jobs before. Building and painting minis has
                gotten me through a lot of tough times in my life as it helps me destress,</p>
            <h3>Joy of painting</h3>
            <p>Many people in the hobby don't even play the game itself and just paint minis. 40k is chock full of
                incredibly sculpted minis that range from realitively easy to paint to incredibly complex.
                Another side of the hobby I enjoy is the improvement of actually painting. I have watched myself get
                better at painting over the years and can actually paint some pretty good looking stuff. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="tab5">
            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>The gameplay itself while complex at first does eventually click as you keep playing. All you need are
                some dice, a measuring tape, and the rules and models for your faction.
                You can play everything from massive planet-shaking battles to fast-paced games with smaller armies. The
                core loop comes down to moving your models using special abilities and attacking enemy models in both
                ranged and melee combat.
                While some armies are more melee based than ranged and vice versa most armies will allow you to use both
                types.</p>
            <h3>Phases</h3>
            <p>The match itself takes place over 5 rounds and in each round are 5 phases the players must go through.
                The phases are "Command, Movement, Shooting, Charge, and Fight" in older editions there were also the
                Psychic and Morale phases,
                but Morale happens in command now, and Psychic is used during the shooting and fight phases now. While
                most are self explanatory the phases can sometimes seem complex but in the most recent edition they have
                attempted to make it easier to play</p>
