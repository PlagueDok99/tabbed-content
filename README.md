# Tabbed Content Project
This is my Tabbed Content project that I created during my JavaScript course. It was designed to show that I understood how to create tabs using both JS and CSS. I was given the option to use any subject to fill it out so I chose my hobby **Warhammer 40K**

## *What is in this project*
There are 5 tabs in this project each about different subjects in the hobby, these tabs are titled as follows.

* What is 40k
* The universe of 40k
* Factions
* Models
* Gameplay

Here is an example of some css code that I used to decorate the page, and yes I made the page have gross color combination on purpose don't worry I'm not that bad at color theory.
``` body {
    background: rgb(63, 81, 138);
    font-size: 1.25em;
    color: #65ff6d;
    width: 80%;
    margin: auto;
}

.container {
    margin: 40px;
    margin-top: 60px;
}

h1 {
    text-align: center;
}
```
